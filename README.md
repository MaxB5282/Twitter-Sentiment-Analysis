# Introduction

When I sat down to work on a Sentiment Analysis project I pondered what might be a good topic to analyze. A couple days prior to this the Roe v. Wade case made headlines as congress looked to potentially overturn their previous decision on the case.

The previous decesion was that the United States would give woman liberty to choose to have an abortion without government restriction.

I wanted to see what twitter had to say about this.

# Insights

For my sentiment analysis I used 2 different natural language proccessors(TextBlob and NaiveBayesAnalyzer). This way I could compare and contrast results to come up with a better story.

Both of these NLP's gave similiar results when I fed them multiple streams of tweets, however I like Textblobs analyzer a little more as it allows tweet sentiment to fall under a 'Nuetral' category

After cleaning and analyzing the data I found that:
- 29% of tweets were positive
- 8% of tweets were negative
- 63% of tweets were nuetral

This was a very fun project to work on. It would be interesting to dive deeper into these metrics and provide additonal explanation.
